  Abstract: "In this talk, we highlight how we are using generative AI for antibiotic discovery and synthetic biology. In the first part of the talk, we focus on the Antibiotics-AI Project, which is a multi-disciplinary, innovative research program that is leveraging MIT's strengths in artificial intelligence, bioengineering, and the life sciences to discover and design novel classes of antibiotics. The Antibiotics-AI Project is focused on developing, integrating and implementing deep learning models and chemogenomic screening approaches: (1) to predict novel antibiotics from expansive chemical libraries with diverse properties, (2) to design de novo novel antibiotics based on learned structural and functional properties of existing and newly discovered antibiotics, and (3) to identify, using explainable deep learning models, the chemical structures and molecular mechanisms underlying the newly discovered and/or designed antibiotics.Our platform has been designed so that it can be utilized and applied in a rapid fashion to emerging and re-emerging bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. In the second part of the talk, we focus on synthetic biology, which is an emerging field that is bringing together engineers, computer scientists and biologists to model, design and construct biological circuits out of proteins, genes and other bits of DNA, and to use these circuits to rewire and reprogram organisms.  These re-engineered organisms are going to change our lives in the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, rapid diagnostic tests, and synthetic probiotics to treat infections and a range of complex diseases. We highlight recent efforts that use generative AI in the context of synthetic biology to create novel classes of diagnostics, therapeutics, and programmable molecular tools for the life sciences."

  Presenter: David Baker
  Time: 10:00-11:00
  Abstract: Proteins mediate the critical processes of life and beautifully solve the challenges faced during the evolution of modern organisms.  The focus of our lab is the design of a new generation of proteins that address current-day problems not faced during evolution. In contrast to traditional protein engineering efforts which modify naturally occurring proteins, we design new proteins from scratch to optimally solve these problems. We develop and use deep learning methods to design these new proteins with new functions, produce synthetic genes encoding the designs, and characterize them experimentally. In this talk, I will describe the design of proteins to address current challenges in health, technology, and sustainability.

- Title: "Invited keynote talk: From Genome to Theorem: Can AI Agents Do Science?"
  Presenter: Mengdi Wang
  Abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored as tools for scientific reasoning - not just in language tasks, but across disciplines such as math, biology, and genomics. In this talk, I'll discuss recent developments in AI for science, including genome language models, AI gene-editing co-scientist, and LLMs for math. I'll highlight both the capabilities and current limitations of LLMs, and discuss key gaps between AI and science such as the overoptimism in AI's capabilities and the lack of benchmark and rigorous evaluation. As we push toward AI systems that can assist with discovery, the question remains: can LLMs truly do science - or are we still in the early stages of bridging that divide?"

  Time: 15:30-16:10
  Presenter: Eric P. Xing
  Abstract: "Toward AI-Driven Digital Organism: Multiscale Foundation Models for Predicting, Simulating, and Programming Biology at All Levels: At the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health, longevity, agriculture, and environment, is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to manipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this talk, I present a vision of using AI to model and simulate biology and life. I will layout an engineering viable approach to construct an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), leveraging self-supervised pretraining and adaption of large-scale foundation models, and I introduce some early results including 5 SOTA foundation models for DNA, RNA, Protein, Structure, and Single Cell, respectively, and their abilities to tackle biological problems at the full spectrum of granularities, from sequence, to structure, to network, to phenotype, to diseases, and to drug responses. We envision that AIDO opens up a safe, affordable, and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting, simulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to individuals, and is poised to trigger a new wave of better-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle reasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life."
